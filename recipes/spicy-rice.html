    <h1>Spicy Rice</h1>
    <p><img src="../images/spicy-rice.jpg" alt="Image of spicy rice"></p>

    <p>Here’s my recipe for Nando’s style <em>spicy rice.</em> 
    Tasty, mildy spicy rice which you can cook at home! 
    The Portuguese restaurant’s popular side dish is made using 
    fluffy rice, turmeric and cumin.</p>

    <p>This rice has onions, peppers and peas in it – it’s 
    perfect paired with chicken!</p>

    <p>One of the benefits of making this at home 
    (despite it honestly being BETTER than Nandos rice) 
    is you can cook as much as you like! I tend to cook a 
    large pan full and then eat it throughout the week with
    different dishes. It works great with chicken, fish, 
    or just about any meat.</p>

    <h2><strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
  <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
  <li>1/4 tsp dried chilli flakes</li>
  <li>1 tbsp turmeric</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
  <li>500g water</li>
  <li>1 chicken stock cube, (You could use vegetable stock instead)</li>
  <li>120g peas</li>
  <li>1/2 onion (diced)</li>
  <li>1/2 red pepper (diced)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong><em>Steps:</em></strong></h2>
<ol>
  <li>Chop the onion and pepper into small pieces</li>
  <li>Heat oil in a large non-stick pan</li>
  <li>Add onions and peppers and cook for a few minutes</li>
  <li>Add spice mixture</li>
  <li>Stir to coat the onions and peppers and cook for a few moments</li>
  <li>Add the rice, water and chicken stock</li>
  <li> Bring mixture to boil</li>
  <li> Then add peas and reduce the heat to as low as possible</li>
  <li> Cover with a lid and cook on very low for around 30 minutes 
      (or until rice is cooked)</li>
  <li> Mix a few times throughout the cooking time to make sure the 
      rice doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan</li>
</ol>
